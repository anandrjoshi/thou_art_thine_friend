			Development Expereince and Status Report
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------	

Status Report:
1. I have a BHO that attaches itself to an instance of IE and which is destroyed 
when that session of IE is closed.
2. I am able to get the URL of the page currently being viewed.
3. I am able to create an HTTP session and connections and get a response 
with other websites like www.google.com.
But I am unable to establish connection with the given API. I tried to put in the
URL for the API directly on the browser I still got Error 400. I tried several 
combinations but still no luck. This is where my lack of knowledge about web 
development betrayed me. I tried a lot of combinations with the given API's URL 
to atleast get some response from it, but failed. I guess this is how an API works.
It does not allow random URLs to establish connection.

Development Experience:
1. I had never before done a lot of things that I did in last couple of days. To
name a few,
a. addition of registry entries
b. creating a dll and ATL project in VS2010
c. BHO: never even heard of such a thing
d. adding an extension for IE as a BHO
e. creating a toolbar entry in IE
f. web based programming using HTTP sessions
g. adding a registry entry from VS2010 application
f. using VS2010 in Administrator mode (spent a lot of time on figuring this out)
g. creating a native dll and using iexplore.exe to open it

It was an exciting weekend where I got to learn a lot of things. Things that I would
not have thought of on my own.
I only feel sad that I was not able to finish it on time.
